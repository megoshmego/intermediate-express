Updated list of terms and definitions:

1. JSON API: An application programming interface that uses JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) as the data format for communication between client and server.
2. Validation: The process of checking whether data conforms to specified rules and constraints.
3. JSON Schema: A specification that defines the structure, data types, and validation rules for JSON data.
4. Backend: The server-side of a web application that handles data processing, storage, and communication with the client-side.
5. Corrupt Data: Data that is malformed or inconsistent, causing errors or unexpected behavior in an application.
6. Data Format: The structure and organization of data, defining how it should be represented and interpreted.
7. Error Handling: The process of managing and responding to errors or exceptions in software.
8. Strict Validation: Enforcing strict rules and constraints on data to ensure its integrity and correctness.
9. Error Messages: Information provided to users or developers when validation fails, indicating what went wrong and how to resolve the issue.
10. JSON Schema Validator: A tool or library that validates JSON data against a JSON Schema.
11. Numeric Types: Data types in JSON Schema that include integers and numbers with additional constraints such as minimum, maximum, and multiples.
12. Range: A specified interval of values defined by minimum and maximum constraints.
13. String: A data type in JSON Schema that represents textual data.
14. Length: A constraint that specifies the minimum and/or maximum length of a string.
15. Regular Expressions (Regex): A powerful tool for matching and manipulating strings based on patterns.
16. Format: A predefined validation rule in JSON Schema for common data formats like email addresses, URLs, and IP addresses.
17. Customization: The ability to define and customize error messages and feedback in JSON Schema validation.
18. AJV (Another JSON Schema Validator): A popular JSON Schema validator for Node.js known for its speed and compatibility with the AJV errors package for custom error handling.
19. Integration: The process of combining or incorporating different components or systems together.
20. jsonschema package: A Node.js package used for validating JSON data against a JSON schema.
21. Schema: A formal definition that describes the structure, constraints, and properties of JSON data.
22. Data Validation: The process of ensuring that data meets specific criteria or requirements.
23. Route: A specific URL endpoint in a web application that handles incoming requests and generates responses.
24. Valid Request: A request that conforms to the specified JSON schema and satisfies all validation rules.
25. Invalid Request: A request that fails to meet the requirements or constraints defined in the JSON schema.
26. Express: A popular web application framework for Node.js used to build web applications and APIs.
27. Error Handling: The process of detecting and responding to errors or exceptions that occur during program execution.
28. Stack: A stack trace or call stack, which represents the sequence of function calls and their corresponding source code locations during program execution.
29. Metadata: Additional information about a JSON schema, such as title, description, and examples.
30. Inference: The process of automatically deriving a schema from existing JSON data.
31. Reference: The ability to refer to and reuse other JSON schemas within a schema.
32. Properties: A property in a JSON schema that defines the fields and their constraints within an object.
33. Pattern: A property in a JSON schema that specifies a regular expression pattern that a string field must match.
34. Schema Validation: The process of validating JSON data against a JSON schema to ensure its compliance with the defined structure and constraints.
