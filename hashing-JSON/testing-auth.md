1. Testing: The process of evaluating the functionality, correctness, and performance of software through various techniques and tools.

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook that provides an easy-to-use and powerful set of testing utilities.

3. Supertest: A library that provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP requests made with Node.js, compatible with testing frameworks like Jest.

4. beforeEach: A function in testing frameworks like Jest that allows you to define setup tasks that need to be executed before each test case.

5. NODE_ENV: An environment variable in Node.js that specifies the current environment (e.g., development, production, test).

6. Test database: A separate database used specifically for running tests to avoid interfering with the production or development databases.

7. bcrypt_work_factor: A configuration variable that determines the number of rounds used for the bcrypt password hashing algorithm.

8. Hashed password: The result of applying a hashing algorithm to a password, which transforms the password into a fixed-length string of characters.

9. JSON Web Token (JWT): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties, often used for authentication and authorization purposes.

10. Test case: A specific scenario or condition that is tested to ensure that the software behaves as expected.

11. expect: A function provided by testing frameworks like Jest that allows you to define assertions and expectations about the behavior or output of your code.

12. objectContaining: A matcher function in Jest that allows you to check if an object contains certain properties or values.

Here's a quick guide example for writing tests using Jest and Supertest for an authentication system:

```javascript
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../app');

describe('Authentication Tests', () => {
  let token;

  beforeEach(async () => {
    // Perform setup tasks before each test case
    // e.g., insert test users, generate tokens

    // Example: Generate a token for a test user
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/login')
      .send({ username: 'test', password: 'secret' });

    token = response.body.token;
  });

  afterAll(async () => {
    // Perform cleanup tasks after all test cases
    // e.g., delete test data, close database connection
  });

  it('should register a new user', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/register')
      .send({ username: 'newuser', password: 'password123' });

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body.username).toEqual('newuser');
  });

  it('should log in a user and return a token', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/login')
      .send({ username: 'test', password: 'secret' });

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    expect(response.body).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({ token: expect.any(String) }));
  });

  it('should protect a route with a valid token', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .get('/protected-route')
      .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);

    expect(response.status).toBe(200);
    // Add more assertions as needed
  });

  it('should reject a route without a token', async () => {
    const response = await request(app).get('/protected-route');

    expect(response.status).toBe(401);
    // Add more assertions as needed
  });

  // Add more test cases for different scenarios

});
```

In the example above, we're using Jest and Supertest to write tests for an authentication system
