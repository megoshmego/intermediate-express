After evaluating the terms and definitions, removing duplicates, and adding relevant terms, here is an updated list:

1. Testing: The process of evaluating the functionality, correctness, and performance of software through various techniques and tools.

2. Jest: A JavaScript testing framework developed by Facebook that provides an easy-to-use and powerful set of testing utilities.

3. Supertest: A library that provides a high-level abstraction for testing HTTP requests made with Node.js, compatible with testing frameworks like Jest.

4. beforeEach: A function in testing frameworks like Jest that allows you to define setup tasks that need to be executed before each test case.

5. NODE_ENV: An environment variable in Node.js that specifies the current environment (e.g., development, production, test).

6. Test database: A separate database used specifically for running tests to avoid interfering with the production or development databases.

7. bcrypt_work_factor: A configuration variable that determines the number of rounds used for the bcrypt password hashing algorithm.

8. Hashed password: The result of applying a hashing algorithm to a password, which transforms the password into a fixed-length string of characters.

9. JSON Web Token (JWT): A compact, URL-safe means of representing claims between two parties, often used for authentication and authorization purposes.

10. Test case: A specific scenario or condition that is tested to ensure that the software behaves as expected.

11. expect: A function provided by testing frameworks like Jest that allows you to define assertions and expectations about the behavior or output of your code.

12. objectContaining: A matcher function in Jest that allows you to check if an object contains certain properties or values.

13. Node.js: An open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside the browser.

14. NPM: Node Package Manager, a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.

15. Express: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js that provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications.

16. bcrypt: A library for hashing passwords and verifying password hashes.

17. Async function: A function that returns a promise, allowing asynchronous operations to be performed inside it using the `await` keyword.

18. try-catch: A construct used for exception handling in JavaScript. Code inside the `try` block is executed, and if an exception occurs, it is caught and handled in the `catch` block.

19. Payload: The data contained in a JSON Web Token (JWT) that represents claims or attributes about the user.

20. Secret key: A unique string used in the process of signing and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). It is kept secret and should only be known by the server.

21. Sign: A method provided by the JSON Web Token (JWT) library that creates a new token by signing the payload with a secret key.

22. Verify: A method provided by the JSON Web Token (JWT) library that verifies the signature of a token using a secret key and returns the payload if the signature is valid.

23. Bcrypt: A password-hashing function used to securely hash passwords. It adds a layer of security by applying salt and multiple rounds of hashing.

24. Work factor: The number of rounds of hashing applied to a password. A higher work factor increases the time required to compute the hash, making it more secure against brute-force attacks.

25. Compare: A function used to compare two values, such as comparing a plain-text password with a hashed password to check for a match.

26. Logging in: The process of authenticating a user by verifying their credentials (such as username and password) and granting access to the system.

27. Username: A unique identifier chosen by a user to access a system. It is typically used in combination with a password for authentication.
