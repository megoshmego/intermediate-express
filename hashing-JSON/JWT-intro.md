1. Authentication: The process of verifying the identity of a user or entity.
2. Authorization: Granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user's permissions.
3. bcrypt: A password-hashing function used to securely store passwords by converting them into irreversible hash values.
4. Express: A popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the process of building APIs and web applications.
5. Stateful protocol: A communication protocol that maintains state information about each active session between the client and the server.
6. Stateless protocol: A communication protocol that does not store any state information about each session between the client and the server.
7. JSON Web Token (JWT): An open standard (pronounced "jot") for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.
8. Session: A way to store and maintain user-specific data on the server side for a specific period of time.
9. Flask: A web application framework for Python used to build web applications.
10. Token-based authentication: An authentication method where a token (such as JWT) is used to authenticate and authorize requests instead of traditional session-based authentication.
11. Same Origin Policy: A security feature in web browsers that prevents JavaScript code from making requests to a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) unless explicitly allowed.
12. OAuth: An open standard for authorization that allows users to grant third-party applications access to their resources without sharing their credentials.
13. Single-Page Application (SPA): A web application that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates its content without requiring full page reloads.

Quick Guide Examples:

1. Generating a JWT token in Express:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';

const payload = {
  userId: 123,
  username: 'john.doe',
  isAdmin: true
};

const token = jwt.sign(payload, secretKey);
console.log('JWT token:', token);
```

2. Verifying and decoding a JWT token in Express:
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
const token = 'your_jwt_token';

jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Token verification failed:', err);
  } else {
    console.log('Decoded token:', decoded);
  }
});
```

3. Protecting a route with JWT authentication in Express:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = 'your_secret_key';
const app = express();

// Middleware to verify JWT token
const authenticateToken = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization;

  if (token) {
    jwt.verify(token, secretKey, (err, decoded) => {
      if (err) {
        return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Invalid token' });
      } else {
        req.user = decoded;
        next();
      }
    });
  } else {
    res.status(401).json({ error: 'Unauthorized' });
  }
};

// Protected route that requires authentication
app.get('/protected', authenticateToken, (req, res) => {
  res.json({ message: 'Authenticated', user: req.user });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server started on port 3000');
});
```

These examples demonstrate the usage of JWTs for authentication and provide a quick guide to understand and implement JWTs in your own projects using Express.
