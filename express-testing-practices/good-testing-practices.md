Here are the terms and definitions extracted from the script:

1. Testing: The process of evaluating the functionality, correctness, and performance of software through the execution of test cases.
2. Mocking: The practice of simulating certain components or behaviors within a system during testing to isolate specific functionality and dependencies.
3. Best practices: Established guidelines and methods that are considered optimal for achieving a desired outcome or goal.
4. End-to-end testing: A type of testing that evaluates the entire system or application flow, simulating real user interactions and verifying the integration of different components.
5. Coverage percentage: A metric used to measure the proportion of code or functionality covered by tests.
6. README: A file, typically in Markdown format, that provides information about a project, including its purpose, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
7. Markdown: A lightweight markup language used for formatting plain text, commonly used in documentation files like READMEs.
8. Scripts: Customizable commands defined in the package.json file that can be executed using NPM (Node Package Manager).
9. Test script: A specific script defined in the package.json file to run the tests of an application.
10. NPM run: A command used to execute custom scripts defined in the package.json file.

And here are some quick guide examples and code snippets:

1. Mocking example in JavaScript (using Jest and axios-mock-adapter):

```javascript
// Import the required libraries
const axios = require('axios');
const MockAdapter = require('axios-mock-adapter');

// Create a mock instance
const mock = new MockAdapter(axios);

// Mock the response for a specific request
mock.onGet('/users').reply(200, {
  users: [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }],
});

// Perform a request using axios
axios.get('/users').then((response) => {
  console.log(response.data);
});

// The response will be the mocked data:
// { users: [{ id: 1, name: 'John' }, { id: 2, name: 'Jane' }] }
```

2. End-to-end testing example in Cypress:

```javascript
// Visit the application URL
cy.visit('https://example.com');

// Interact with elements on the page
cy.get('input[name="username"]').type('john');
cy.get('input[name="password"]').type('password');
cy.get('button[type="submit"]').click();

// Assert that a specific element or content is present
cy.contains('Welcome, John').should('be.visible');

// Perform additional actions and assertions as needed
// ...

// Cleanup or reset the application state if required
// ...
```

3. Adding a test script in package.json:

```json
{
  "name": "my-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jest": "^27.0.6"
  }
}
```

With the above configuration, you can execute the tests by running the command `npm run test` in the terminal.

These examples and snippets provide a glimpse into mocking, end-to-end testing, and the usage of scripts in testing practices. You can explore these concepts further and adapt them to your specific testing needs and tools.
