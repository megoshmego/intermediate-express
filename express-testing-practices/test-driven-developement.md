Terms and Definitions:
1. JSON Schema: A JSON-based format for defining the structure, constraints, and validation rules of JSON data.
2. Property: A key-value pair in a JSON object.
3. Type: A property in JSON Schema that specifies the expected data type for a given property.
4. Required: A property in JSON Schema that indicates whether a property is mandatory or optional.
5. Multiples: A numeric validation in JSON Schema that specifies that a number must be a multiple of a given value.
6. Range: A numeric validation in JSON Schema that specifies the minimum and maximum values for a number.
7. Inclusive: A range validation in JSON Schema that includes the specified minimum or maximum value.
8. Exclusive: A range validation in JSON Schema that excludes the specified minimum or maximum value.
9. Length: A string validation in JSON Schema that specifies the minimum and maximum length of a string.
10. Regular Expressions: A sequence of characters that define a search pattern, used in JSON Schema for pattern-based string validation.
11. Format: A property in JSON Schema that specifies a predefined format for common data types like email, URL, or IP address.
12. Validation: The process of checking whether a JSON document conforms to a defined JSON Schema.

Quick Guide Examples:
1. Numeric Validation:
   - Multiples: A number must be a multiple of 10, 30, 5, or 7.
   - Range: An age property must be greater than zero.
   - Inclusive Range: A book's year property must be less than or equal to 2020.
2. String Validation:
   - Length: A string property must have a minimum and maximum length.
   - Regular Expressions: Matching a North American phone number using a predefined pattern.
3. Format Validation:
   - Email: Validating an email property using the built-in email format.

Code Snippets:
1. Numeric Validation:
   ```
   {
       "type": "integer",
       "multipleOf": 10
   }
   ```
   This snippet validates that a number must be a multiple of 10.

2. Range Validation:
   ```
   {
       "type": "integer",
       "minimum": 1,
       "maximum": 100
   }
   ```
   This snippet validates that an integer must be between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

3. String Length Validation:
   ```
   {
       "type": "string",
       "minLength": 5,
       "maxLength": 10
   }
   ```
   This snippet validates that a string must have a length between 5 and 10 characters.

4. Regular Expression Validation:
   ```
   {
       "type": "string",
       "pattern": "^[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{3}-[0-9]{4}$"
   }
   ```
   This snippet validates that a string property matches a specific pattern, such as a North American phone number in the format XXX-XXX-XXXX.

5. Format Validation:
   ```
   {
       "type": "string",
       "format": "email"
   }
   ```
   This snippet validates that a string property represents a valid email address.
