Here are the refined terms and definitions:

1. Continuous Integration (CI): A development practice that involves frequently merging small code changes into a shared repository and running automated tests to ensure the code remains functional.
2. Continuous Integration Server: A server or service that facilitates the automation of the continuous integration process by running tests and performing other tasks whenever code changes are pushed to a repository.
3. Test Suite: A collection of test cases that are designed to verify the correctness and functionality of a software application.
4. Build: The process of compiling and linking source code files to create an executable or deployable version of a software application.
5. Deployment: The process of releasing a software application for use in a particular environment, such as a production server or a client's system.
6. Version Control System (VCS): A system that tracks changes to files and directories over time, enabling multiple developers to collaborate on a project and manage code revisions effectively. Git is an example of a popular VCS.
7. Travis CI: A continuous integration service that integrates with GitHub and runs automated tests on code changes pushed to a repository. It provides build and test status feedback to developers.
8. Jenkins: An open-source continuous integration server that allows developers to automate various tasks related to building, testing, and deploying software applications.
9. Circle CI: A continuous integration and delivery platform that automates the build, test, and deployment processes for software projects.
10. Buddy: A DevOps platform that offers continuous integration and delivery features, allowing developers to automate various stages of software development and deployment.
11. JSON Schema: A JSON-based format for defining the structure, constraints, and validation rules of JSON data.
12. Property: A key-value pair in a JSON object.
13. Type: A property in JSON Schema that specifies the expected data type for a given property.
14. Required: A property in JSON Schema that indicates whether a property is mandatory or optional.
15. Multiples: A numeric validation in JSON Schema that specifies that a number must be a multiple of a given value.
16. Range: A numeric validation in JSON Schema that specifies the minimum and maximum values for a number.
17. Inclusive: A range validation in JSON Schema that includes the specified minimum or maximum value.
18. Exclusive: A range validation in JSON Schema that excludes the specified minimum or maximum value.
19. Length: A string validation in JSON Schema that specifies the minimum and maximum length of a string.
20. Regular Expressions: A sequence of characters that define a search pattern, used in JSON Schema for pattern-based string validation.
21. Format: A property in JSON Schema that specifies a predefined format for common data types like email, URL, or IP address.
22. Validation: The process of checking whether a JSON document conforms to a defined JSON Schema.
23. Mocking: Creating a simulated or fake version of a dependency or behavior during testing to isolate specific functionality and eliminate unpredictability or external dependencies.
24. Unit testing: Testing individual units or components of code to ensure their functionality in isolation.
25. External tools/libraries: Third-party tools or libraries used in an application that may introduce dependencies or randomness.
26. Jest: A popular JavaScript testing framework commonly used for unit testing, providing built-in mocking capabilities.
27. Mock function: A function created using Jest's `jest.fn()` that can be controlled and monitored during testing.
28. Mock object: An object returned by `jest.fn()` that provides additional properties and methods to track calls, arguments, and other interactions with the mocked function.
29. `mock.calls`: A property of the mock object that contains an array of all the calls made to the mocked function, including the arguments passed in each call.
30. `expect().toHaveBeenCalled()`: A Jest matcher used to verify
